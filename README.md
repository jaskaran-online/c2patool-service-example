# c2patool Node.js service example 

[This repository](https://github.com/contentauth/c2patool-service-example) is an example of a very simple Node.js service that uploads images and adds a C2PA manifest to each image.  It is written in plain Javascript, HTML, and CSS to be as generic as possible.

NOTE: This is **NOT** an example of the C2PA Javascript API. Rather, it demonstrates how a server application using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) can call c2patool to add content credentials in a C2PA manifest to an image. The client JavaScript code simply displays information from the manifests.

## Install and build

Follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm from <https://nodejs.org/en/download>.
1. Clone this repo by entering this command in a terminal window:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/contentauth/c2patool-service-example.git
    ```
1. Download the latest version of c2patool for your platform from <https://github.com/contentauth/c2patool/releases>.
1. Extract the zip file and put a copy of the `c2patool` executable in the root of this repo (`c2pa_service_example` directory).  NOTE: Depending on your operating system, you may need to take some extra steps to be able to run this file; for example on MacOS you have to [follow the instructions to open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).  
1. Open a terminal window and install the required packages. Enter these commands
    ```
    cd <path_where_you_cloned_repo>/c2patool-service-example
    npm install
    ```
1. Start the service by entering this command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    You'll see this in your terminal:
    ```
    > c2pa_serve@0.1.0 start
    > nodemon server.js

    [nodemon] 2.0.21
    [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
    [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
    [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
    [nodemon] starting `node server.js`
    CAI HTTP server listening on port 8000.
    ```

## Try the web app

1. Open a browser to <http://localhost:8000>.
1. Click the **Choose Files** button and select one or more JPEG or PNG images in the native file chooser dialog. 
    <br/>The service uploads the selected images, stores them in the `uploads` folder, and then calls the C2PA Tool to add a C2PA manifest to each image and signs it with demo certificate and private key built-in to the C2PA Tool.  The signed image is stored in the `uploads` folder.
3. Hover over the badge for information about the associated manifest.
4. The service returns the full-sized image, not thumbnails.
5. Right-click and download an image to view the credentials on <https://verify.contentauthenticity.org/>.

### Overview of the app

The code in `server.js` contains all the server-side logic.  It defines three routes:
- GET `/version` displays the version of c2patool being used
- POST `/upload` uploads a file, and calls out to C2PA Tool to add a C2PA manifest and sign the asset's Content Credentials.  C2PA Tool signs the manifest using the built-in test certificate and key, because the `manifest.json` file in this repository doesn't contain `private_key` and `sign_cert` fields. See note below about handling keys and certificates securely.
- GET `/`, the default route, serves `client/index.html`, which is a simple page with a user interface you can use to upload one or more files.  The associated client JavaScript is in [`client/index.js`](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa_service_example/blob/main/client/index.js).  Selecting files triggers a [client JavaScript event listener](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa_service_example/blob/main/client/index.js#L89) that calls the `/upload` route for each file and then calls the [`addGalleryItem`](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa_service_example/blob/main/client/index.js#L19) function to display the returned image on the page.

**WARNING**: This application illustrates how to sign an asset using C2PA Tool's built-in test certificate and key for demonstration purposes.  Using C2PA Tool in this way in production is not scalable. Additionally, for production use, you must purchase a valid certificate and key from a certificate authority (CA) and access them securely by using a hardware security module (HSM) and optionally a Key Management Service (KMS); for example as show in the [C2PA Python Example](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-python-example).

## Customizing

The data added to the manifest is determined by the `manifest.json` file in the root folder. To modify the information added to the file, modify `manifest.json`.
